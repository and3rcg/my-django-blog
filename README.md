## About this project <a name="#about"></a>
This blog is a Django project, part of a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-do-zero-ao-avancado/">Python course taught by Luiz Ot√°vio Miranda at Udemy</a>, with extra features gradually added by myself. Since the focus of this project is Python and Django programming, the HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes have been provided by the instructor, with the focus only on Python codes and the Django HTML files.

Also, this project will soon be updated to contain two branches: `master` and `debug`. The `master` branch will be a ready to deploy version, with support to HTTPS and nginx. Meanwhile, the `debug` branch will contain the files for a development version of the blog. As of the latest commit, the `master` branch only contains the debug files.

## Objectives <a name="#objectives"></a>
With this project, I aim to:
 - Attest my experience in software development, version control and website deployment;
